        <h2>1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
        <h5>Ans: The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
            whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends</h5>

        <h2>2. What is the difference between global and block scope?</h2>
        <h5>Ans: Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.They all
            have Global Scope .Block scope is variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the
            block.</h5>

        <h2>3. How does js event loop work?</h2>
        <h5>Ans: Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives
            more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there
            is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.</h5>

        <h2>Ways to get undefined?</h2>
        <h5>Ans: You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above
            example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a
            variable. So in this case, result will be undefined. In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check if an
            object property is undefined is to use the typeof operator. If the value is not defined, typeof returns the
            'undefined' string.</h5>
